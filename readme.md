Monterail Python Developer recruitment task 

Background

We want to develop a ticket-selling platform. We are hoping to get popular pretty quickly, so prepare for high traffic!
The front-end part of the application is not yet ready, so feel free to design the API however you want.
At Monterail we mainly work with Django, so it is highly encouraged to use it for your solution. But if you feel much more comfortable with Flask - that is also accepted.

High-level features

    1. Get info about an event
    2. Get info about available tickets
    3. Reserve ticket
    4. Pay for ticket
    5. Get info about reservation
    6. Get reservation statistics
Feature requirements

Get info about an event

    1. Event has a name
    2. Event has a date and a time
    3. Event can have multiple types of tickets (eg. regular, premium, VIP)

Get info about available tickets

    • We should be able to receive information about tickets, including which are still available for sale and in which quantity.
Reserve ticket

    • Reservation is valid for 15 minutes, after that it is released.
Pay for the ticket

    • No need to integrate any third-party solutions. Feel free to use the provided below PaymentGateway - let’s assume it’s enough to make a payment.
    • For the sake of simplicity we operate only in the EUR currency.
Get info about reservation

    • Return information about the state of the reservation and its data
Get reservation statistics

    • Get a summary amount of reserved tickets for each event
    • Get a summary amount of reserved tickets of a specified type (eg. a total number of reserved VIP tickets)
    • Feel free to add any other interesting statistics
Additional info

    1. We really don't want to push you in any certain direction, but if you've made certain assumptions how it should work with FE then please let us know. TL;DR - you can briefly describe how the whole app would interact.
    2. Please use a relational (SQL) database such as Postgres, MySQL or SQLite.
    3. Goes without saying, but tests would be highly appreciated.
